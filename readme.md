# Web layout template
> gulp + bower + sass + compass + react

	This is my own starter template to simplify web layout development. It uses gulp for packaging and many pre-configured modules:

* sass + compass
* jade
* bower
* react
* bootstrap
* minimize css and js
* optimize images

## Usage

Clone this repo into your local:
```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sergeynechaev/weblayout-template.git <your-project-name>
```

Then, run:
```shell
npm install
bower install
```

## Development

Modify the files under `/src` directory.


## Production

Output is in the folder `/build`
